<h2>Binary numbers</h2>
<p>they are nothing more than transistors on(with energy flowing)/off(without</p>
<p>Each binary digit is also called a bit.</p>
<p>Unlike "normal" numbers binaries numbers have powers of two</p>
<ul>
  <li>2^2 2^1 2^0 (4 2 1)</li>
  <li>001 = 1</li>
  <li>101 = 5</li>
  <li>111 = 7</li>
</ul>
<p>Most computers use 8 bits (2^8  or 256 different values (including zero)) at a time also known as <Bold>Byte</Bold>, like 00000011 for the number 3.</p>

<h2>Representing letters with binary numbers</h2>
<p>The letter “A”, for example, is the number 65, and “B” is 66, and so on. In binary, the letter “A” is the pattern 01000001. By using context, like the file format, different programs can interpret and display the same bits as numbers or text.</p>
<p>The standard mapping, ASCII, also includes lowercase letters and punctuation.</p>

<h3>How can a computer have this mapping from numbers to letters, but still support numbers?</h3>
<p>Different file formats, Excel versus Photoshop versus Google Docs or the like, we shall interpret any patterns of zeros and ones as being maybe numbers for Excel, maybe letters in, like, a text messaging program or Google Docs, or maybe even colors of the rainbow in something like Photoshop and more. So it's context dependent.</p>

<h2>Representing Images and videos</h2>
<p>With bits, we can map numbers to colors as well. There are many different systems to represent colors, but a common one is RGB, which represents colors by indicating the amount of red, green, and blue within each color, each number might be 8 bits, with 256 possible values.</p>
