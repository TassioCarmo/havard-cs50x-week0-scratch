<h2>Binary numbers</h2>
<p>they are nothing more than transistors on(with energy flowing)/off(without</p>
<p>Each binary digit is also called a bit.</p>
<p>Unlike "normal" numbers binaries numbers have powers of two</p>
<ul>
  <li>2^2 2^1 2^0 (4 2 1)</li>
  <li>001 = 1</li>
  <li>101 = 5</li>
  <li>111 = 7</li>
</ul>
<p>Most computers use 8 bits at a time also known as <bold>Byte</bold>, like 00000011 for the number 3.</p>
